These scripts create a cross-compiler toolchain in your $HOME/usr directory.
This kind of cross-compiler is mostly useful for basic Operating System developpment.

== INCLUDED PACKAGES ==

These scripts install the following things in the toolchain :
- binutils (ld, ...)
- gcc for C and C++

== SETTING UP THE CROSS-COMPILER ==

- Create a directory named `usr` in your home directory.
- Add the following line to your .bashrc :
	export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/usr/bin
- Run cross-<arch>.sh for the architecture you target
	Go on the internet and read some useless stuff, this step is long.

== SUPPORTED CROSS-COMPILING ARCHITECTURES ==

  ARCH		PREFIX
- x86		i586-elf
- arm		arm-elf

== USING THE CROSS-COMPILER ==

The compiler is available as *-gcc and *-g++, where * is one of the prefixes listed above (ex: i586-elf-gcc).
